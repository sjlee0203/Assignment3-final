            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <pre>
                1. Title tag (&lt;title&gt;)
                - The &#39;&lt;title&gt;&#39; tag defines the title of the page, which contains information about &quot;Kendo&quot; and
                sets the title to &quot;Kendo.&quot;

                2. Head sector (&lt;Head&gt;)
                - In the head sector, I attached a link to the font obtained from Google Font, and imported the
                style.css to apply the css file I wrote separately to the html.

                3. Page, intro sector
                - I used div tags to divide the page into different parts, and I named and managed them with
                class=&quot;&quot;. And the &#39;&lt;a&gt;&#39; tag creates a hyperlink, which has a &quot;Home&quot; menu and is set to return to
                the homepage when the user clicks on it.

                4. Text section
                - For the text, I needed to write large text in the centre of the photo, but I had set the font-size
                to 15px in the css, so I used the &lt;span&gt; tag to write the word &quot;Kendo&quot; and used font-
                size=&quot;400%&quot; to use 60px, which is 4 times the size of 15px. The sentences describing kendo
                are punctuated with &lt;p&gt; and line breaks with &lt;br /&gt;.

                5. Rules sector
                - I defined everything below the intro and text section as an article, I also divided the big parts,
                rules and photoparts, into &lt;section&gt;. And since the header of the article is an explanation of the
                rules, which is one of the most important parts of the page, I used the largest header, &lt;h1&gt;. I
                also used class=&quot;float-left&quot; to align the pictures of the different striking parts of kendo to the left
                side of the page and used width and height to size the images. and I used &lt;p&gt; to break each
                paragraph into sections and &lt;br /&gt; to wrap each line. At the end, I used &lt;a&gt; to attach a
                hyperlink.

                6. Photo sector
                - Because the photo sector is less important than the rules, and I need to emphasise the rules
                more, I used a &lt;h2&gt; for the header, which is smaller than the &lt;h1&gt; in the rules. And to keep the
                photos equally spaced and neatly arranged, I used a &lt;table&gt;. Since there are three photos and
                they will all fit on a single line, we defined the row of the table with &lt;tr&gt; and aligned them by
                putting the image inside the &lt;th&gt;.

                7. Backlink with author (&lt;Footer&gt;)
                - At the very end of the page, I wrote the author of the page, which is my name and provides a
                link for the user to return to another page using &lt;footer&gt; and &lt;a&gt;.
            </pre>

            <h3>CSS</h3>
            <pre>
                1. body
                - I wrote information about the font in the body, which I got from Google Fonts.

                2. page
                - To set a homepage-wide background picture on the page, I used text-align: centre to align the
                picture to the centre and set the wallpaper with background-image:url&quot;&quot;. And to place the text at
                the centre of the photo, I used position: relative.

                3. intro
                - In the intro, I inserted a background picture and used background-repeat: no-repeat to prevent
                the picture from repeating. I used background-size: 100% auto to make sure the photo fits the
                page size. I also used filter:brightness to reduce the brightness of the photo to make the text
                more readable.

                4. text
                - I used position:absolute to centre the text, and top, left, width, text-align, transform: translate( -
                50%, -50%) to position the text in the centre of the photo.I also set the colour of the text to white
                using colour to make it more readable since the brightness of the background photo was
                lowered.

                5. header
                - To make the header stand out more on the page, we used background-colour: to set the
                background colour to white and padding to move it slightly to the right.

                6. nav, img, photos, footer
                - I changed the colour of the hyperlink back to home to white with a:link, a:visited, and removed
                the underline from the link with text-decoration. And the photos should all be left-aligned, so I
                used float: left to make sure they are, and when I created the &lt;table&gt; we lost the margin on the
                right side due to the size of the photos, so I used margin-right to move them slightly to the left to
                centre them. And finally The photos and footer are spaced apart from the top content using
                padding-top to ensure they are readable and not cluttered.

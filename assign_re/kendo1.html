                <ul class="text">Kendo is a traditional Japanese martial art,<br />
                originating in Japan in the 19th century and<br />
                spreading around the world for over 100 years.<br />
                Today, kendo has become a sport and is popular<br />
                all over the world.</ul>

                <h2>Rules</h2>
                <p>The basic rule is simple. The match lasts three minutes,<br />
                    and you get one point for hitting your opponent's men(head),<br />
                    kote(wrist), do(body), and tsuki(throat) with your sinai(bamboo sword).<br />
                    The first player to score two points within the time limit wins,<br />
                    and if the score is still tied after three minutes, the match goes into<br />
                    extra time. In extra time, whoever scores one point first wins.</p>
                 
                 <p>In kendo, the referee checks the momentum, spirit, and posture during<br />
                    the attack to award a point, meaning that a point is not scored simply<br />
                    because the sword touches the opponent. There are three referees: one head referee<br />
                    and two assistant referees. The head referee is in charge of the game, but all<br />
                    three referees have equal power when it comes to scoring. You can get a point<br />
                    when two or more referees agree.</p>
     
                 <p>Fouls include dropping the bamboo sword, leaving the field, touching your own<br/>
                    or your opponent's bamboo sword without the referee's permission, engaging in<br />
                    rough behaviour that intentionally causes harm to an opponent, or displaying<br />
                    unsportsmanlike conduct. If you are fouled twice, your opponent scores 1 point.</p>
